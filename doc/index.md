# IPFS API

A .Net client library to access the IPFS, it implements the [IPFS Core API](https://github.com/ipfs/interface-ipfs-core). 
The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/richardschneider/net-ipfs-api) and the 
package is published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ipfs.Http).

The interplanetary file system is the permanent web. It is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.
